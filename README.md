# Pug Shuffle

## How to Play

Pug Shuffle is a simple memory game where you must click as many different pugs as possible without clicking the same pug twice. If you click all 12 with no repeats, you win.

Each time you click a pug, the 12 pug cards are shuffled, so you must remember which you clicked. When you click the same pug a second time, the game is over and you get your score. Then, the score is reset.

## How it Works

Pug Shuffle uses React to display the cards and score. The Nav, card, and wrapper components were built separately and are rendered in the App.
